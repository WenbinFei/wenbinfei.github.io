ImageJ is a free software that used to deal with CT images.
- Load image stacks
- Mitigate artificial effects
<!-- Different to do this, refer to articles
-->
- Threshold
<!-- How to determine the threshold, the otsu method.
-->
- Watershed segmentation
<!-- Different methods in watershed, watershed definition, Morpholibj
-->
- Particle analysis
<!-- 2D,3D, different plugin: particle analyze, particles8_plus, biovexxol, morpholibj...
-->

We have delivered a course about **X-ray computed tomography (CT) image processing of granular materials**  
**Overall:** Relearning images -> CT Image processing pipeline -> Microstructural analysis  
**Hands-on tutorial #1**  
	ImageJ basics, macro script for batch processing CT images  
**Hands-on tutorial #2**  
	Enhance image: contrast, reduce noise, segment solid and void phases  
**Hands-on tutorial #3**  
	Watershed segmentation, particle extraction &analysis: calculate particle size and shape
The lecture slides are avaliable [by cliking here](courses/Wenbin-Fei_CT-image-processing-course.pdf).
