**[A new energy screw pile with thermal battery core](10-energy-screw-pile.md)**  
An energy screw pile filled enhanced buy phase change materials to solve the challenges of thermal interference and soil temperature accumulation in existing energy piles.

**[Network analysis of heat transfer in granular materials](8-network-analysis.md)**  
Quantify microstructure using complex network theory (graph theory). Construct both contact and thermal networks and use their features to predict thermal conductivity of sphere packings and natural sands.

**[Thermal Conductance Network Model](7-TCNM.md)**  
An alternative method to simulate heat transfer.

**[Rigidity of sands and its impact on heat transfer in granular materials](4-rigidity.md)**  
Rigidity is quantified using complex network theory. Particle shape and local clustering coefficient well relate to predict thermal conductivity of granular materials under loading.
